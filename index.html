<h1>Elliott Martin</h1>

<h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>

<p>I am a freshman at <a href="http://www.bju.edu">Bob Jones University</a> studying Bible with a minor in Greek.</p>
<p>I attend <a href="http://morningside.org/#church-on-mission">Morningside Baptist Church</a>. I am in charge of running a nursing home ministry once a month to Haywood Estates and occasionally play music specials at Southern Oaks Assisted Living. I also help out in youth group, sing in choir, and change the sign for my church.</p>

<p>I enjoy playing soccer, guitar, and ukulele. I have played soccer for 11 years and have played guitar and ukulele each for 4 years.</p>
